# EditorVR
Author VR in VR - Initial public release was on December 15, 2016 via [blogpost](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2016/12/15/editorvr-experimental-build-available-today/)

## Experimental Status
It’s important to note that EditorVR is an experimental feature. As such, there is no formal support (e.g. FogBugz, support@unity3d.com, Premium Support, etc.) offered, so please do not use these channels. Instead, take your questions, suggestions, comments to our dedicated [forum](https://forum.unity3d.com/forums/editorvr.126/).

To help ensure you have a good experience, and to help us answer your questions (hey, we’re a small team!), we encourage you to try it out first with a small VR-ready scene. Please use life-sized objects, nothing too big or small. Dive in and have fun just playing around, instead of trying to use your existing project. 

**As with any experimental/preview/alpha/beta build, it is always a good idea to make a backup of your project before using the build.**

Experimental means this:
- We're still adding features!
- The current menus, tools, workspaces, actions, etc. are not the end-all-be-all. Each of these have individual designs that will change as we experiment with what works best for UX. EditorVR was designed in such a way that we plan on you being able to replace all of these defaults, too, if you so desire.
- Namespaces, classes, software architecture, prefabs, etc. can change at any point. If you are writing your own tools, then you might need to update them as these things change.
- There won’t always be an upgrade path from one release to the next, so you might need to fix things manually, which leads to the next point...
- Stuff can and will break (!)
- There’s **no guarantee** that this project will move out of experimental status within any specific timeframe.
- As such, there is no guarantee that this will remain an actively supported project.

## Getting Started
If you've made it here, but aren't accustomed to using GitHub, cloning repositories, etc. and are simply looking to give EditorVR a spin, then take a look at the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xWunGC3NJoDRBBz44gxpMUAh3SmedtNK12LqACyy2L0). Once you're up and running we recommend you join the discussion on the [EditorVR forum](https://forum.unity3d.com/forums/editorvr.126/).

## For Software Developers
If you're a developer, we recommend that you take a look at the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xWunGC3NJoDRBBz44gxpMUAh3SmedtNK12LqACyy2L0) *and* the companion document [Extending EditorVR](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EGi9hKXAujfBMI2spErojdqRc0giqEnOu0NpwgBxtpg). You'll need to clone the repository into an existing project using the instructions below.

### Git Dependencies
- [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/)
- [git-submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule)

### Project Asset Dependencies
- [Textmesh Pro](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/essentials/beta-projects/textmesh-pro-84126)

### Cloning
1. Create a new Unity project or use an existing one
2. From the command line change directory to your project's `Assets` directory.
3. Run `git lfs clone --recursive -b development https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/EditorVR` **(Use HTTPS!)**

### Updating
Because this project uses [git-submodule](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule), you'll need to execute `git submodule update` after pulling whenever a submodule is updated. You could execute this command always just to be safe or if you notice that a submodule is showing as modified after pulling changes.

Optionally, you could add a [git hook for post-checkout](https://ttboj.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/keeping-git-submodules-in-sync-with-your-branches/) or use a GUI (e.g. SourceTree) that does this automatically for you.

### Project Settings
If you plan on making changes to EditorVR and/or contributing back, then you'll need to set the `Asset Serialization` property under Edit->Project Settings->Editor to `Force Text`.

We're using `#if UNITY_EDITOR` for now in order to keep our code out of your player builds. We will eventually explore a possible overlap between EditorVR and player builds. We recommend you do the same for your tools if you plan to distribute them to others.
